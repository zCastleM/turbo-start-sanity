## Getting Started

### Installing the template

#### 1. Initialize template with Sanity CLI

Run the command in your Terminal to initialize this template on your local computer.

See the documentation if you are [having issues with the CLI](https://www.sanity.io/help/cli-errors).

```shell
npm create sanity@latest -- --template robotostudio/turbo-start-sanity
```

#### 2. Run Studio and Next.js app locally

Navigate to the template directory using `cd <your app name>`, and start the development servers by running the following command

```shell
pnpm run dev
```

#### 3. Open the app and sign in to the Studio

Open the Next.js app running locally in your browser on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Open the Studio running locally in your browser on [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333). You should now see a screen prompting you to log in to the Studio. Use the same service (Google, GitHub, or email) that you used when you logged in to the CLI.

### Adding content with Sanity

#### 1. Publish your first document

The template comes pre-defined with a schema containing `Author`, `Blog`, `BlogIndex`, `FAQ`, `Footer`, `HomePage`, `Navbar`, `Page`, and `Settings` document types.

From the Studio, click "+ Create" and select the `Blog` document type. Go ahead and create and publish the document.

Your content should now appear in your Next.js app ([http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)) as well as in the Studio on the "Presentation" Tab

#### 2. Sample Content

When you initialize the template using the Sanity CLI, sample content is automatically imported into your project. This includes example blog posts, authors, and other content types to help you get started quickly.

#### 3. Extending the Sanity schema

The schemas for all document types are defined in the `studio/schemaTypes/documents` directory. You can [add more document types](https://www.sanity.io/docs/schema-types) to the schema to suit your needs.

### Deploying your application and inviting editors

#### 1. Deploy Sanity Studio

Your Next.js frontend (`/web`) and Sanity Studio (`/studio`) are still only running on your local computer. It's time to deploy and get it into the hands of other content editors.

The template includes a GitHub Actions workflow [`deploy-sanity.yml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robotostudio/turbo-start-sanity/main/.github/workflows/deploy-sanity.yml) that automatically deploys your Sanity Studio whenever changes are pushed to the `studio` directory.

> **Note**: To use the GitHub Actions workflow, make sure to configure the following secrets in your repository settings:
>
> - `SANITY_DEPLOY_TOKEN`
> - `SANITY_STUDIO_PROJECT_ID`
> - `SANITY_STUDIO_DATASET`
> - `SANITY_STUDIO_TITLE`
> - `SANITY_STUDIO_PRESENTATION_URL`

Alternatively, you can manually deploy from your Studio directory (`/studio`) using:

```shell
npx sanity deploy
```

#### 2. Deploy Next.js app to Vercel

You have the freedom to deploy your Next.js app to your hosting provider of choice. With Vercel and GitHub being a popular choice, we'll cover the basics of that approach.

1. Create a GitHub repository from this project. [Learn more](https://docs.github.com/en/migrations/importing-source-code/using-the-command-line-to-import-source-code/adding-locally-hosted-code-to-github).
2. Create a new Vercel project and connect it to your Github repository.
3. Set the `Root Directory` to your Next.js app (`/apps/web`).
4. Configure your Environment Variables.

#### 3. Invite a collaborator

Now that you’ve deployed your Next.js application and Sanity Studio, you can optionally invite a collaborator to your Studio. Open up [Manage](https://www.sanity.io/manage), select your project and click "Invite project members"

They will be able to access the deployed Studio, where you can collaborate together on creating content.
